HDP2.0-VM-setup
===============

I wanted a quick way to setup personal VM's on my laptop so I wrote this to speed up the post OS install process.

In order to build a quick VM in my environment I use the CENTOS6.4 Min install: CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso
It sets up a bare CENTOS install, then run the VM-Set.sh script and it adds in some tools that I like to have 
on the system as well configuring the Host IP address for the System based off Hostname from Hostsfile.
